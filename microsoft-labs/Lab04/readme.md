![Azure Blob Storage client.](./media/Lab04-Diagram.png)

This lab demonstrates how to we can combine the services of blob storage and cosmos db, to create a polyglot solution that can serve images and also give us the query features that Cosmos delivers. 

* Create a storage account for storing the images.
* Create a cosmos db to hold the JSON data that describes products. 
* Upload the JSON data to the cosmos database using the API
* Develop the web front end to allow us to see images and cosmos data based on user criteria.
